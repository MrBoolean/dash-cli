dash-cli
========
You can initiate a Dash search from within Terminal by executing "open dash://{query}".

This also works with docset keywords (defined in Preferences > Docsets) or search profile keyword triggers (defined by clicking on the loupe icon of the main search field).

Keyword example: "open dash://php:{query}".
